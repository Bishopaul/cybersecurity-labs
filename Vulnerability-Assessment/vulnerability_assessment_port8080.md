3. Risk Analysis
Risk Level: Medium (High in production environments)
Why it’s risky
SimpleHTTPServer has:
- No authentication
- No encryption (HTTP only)
- Directory listing enabled
- No access control
- No logging
- No protection against sensitive file exposure
This means anyone who can reach the server can browse and download files from the directory where the server was started.

4. Potential Impact
- Exposure of sensitive files
- Unauthorized access
- Directory traversal (depending on directory content)
- Cleartext transmission of data
- No audit trail for incident response

5. Recommendations
- Stop the server when not needed
- Never run SimpleHTTPServer in directories containing sensitive files
- Restrict access to localhost only (which you already did — good practice)
- Use a hardened web server (Apache/Nginx) for real deployments
- Implement authentication and TLS if hosting real content
