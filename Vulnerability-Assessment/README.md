# **Vulnerability Assessment Report**  
**Target:** iPhone (192.168.1.127)  
**Date:** 12 January 2026  
**Analyst:** Paul

## 📌 **Executive Summary**
A network‑based vulnerability assessment was performed on an iPhone connected to a private network.  
The goal was to identify exposed services, evaluate potential weaknesses, and determine the device’s overall security posture.

The scan identified **two open TCP ports**, both of which are expected and non‑vulnerable for iOS devices.  
No exploitable services or CVEs were detected.  
The device demonstrates a **strong, low‑risk security posture**.

## 📌 **Scope**
- **In‑scope device:** iPhone (192.168.1.127)  
- **Assessment type:** External network vulnerability scan  
- **Tools used:** Nmap  
- **Limitations:** iOS restricts deep probing; only network‑exposed services were evaluated  

---

## 📌 **Methodology**

### **1. Host Discovery**
Used `-Pn` to bypass ICMP filtering and confirm host availability.

### **2. Port Scanning**
Performed a TCP SYN scan with aggressive timing (`-T4`) to enumerate open ports.

### **3. Service Enumeration**
Mapped open ports to known services.

### **4. Vulnerability Assessment**
Attempted to run Nmap’s `vuln` script suite.  
iOS does not expose services compatible with these scripts, resulting in no vulnerabilities detected.

## 📌 **Findings**

### **Open Ports**
| Port | State | Service | Description | Risk |
|------|--------|----------|--------------|-------|
| **49152/tcp** | open | unknown | Ephemeral port used internally by iOS | Low |
| **62078/tcp** | open | iphone-sync | Apple lockdown service for pairing and syncing | Low |

---

## 📌 **Analysis of Findings**

### **Port 62078 — iphone-sync**
- Used for trusted pairing with iTunes/Finder  
- Requires physical access or a trusted pairing record  
- Encrypted and authenticated  
- Not remotely exploitable  

**Risk:** Low  
**Impact:** Minimal  
**Likelihood:** Very low  

### **Port 49152 — Ephemeral Port**
- Dynamically assigned by iOS  
- Not a persistent service  
- Not externally exploitable  

**Risk:** Low  
**Impact:** None  
**Likelihood:** Very low  

---

## 📌 **Vulnerability Scan Results**
- No CVEs detected  
- No insecure services exposed  
- No misconfigurations identified  
- No weak protocols detected  

This is expected behavior for a hardened mobile OS like iOS.

---

## 📌 **Overall Risk Rating**
### **LOW RISK**

The device exposes only essential, hardened system services.  
No vulnerabilities were identified during the assessment.

---

## 📌 **Recommendations**

### **1. Maintain Current Security Posture**
- Keep iOS updated  
- Avoid jailbreaking  
- Use strong passcodes and biometric authentication  

### **2. Network Hygiene**
- Connect only to trusted Wi‑Fi networks  
- Disable Wi‑Fi when not needed  
- Avoid installing untrusted profiles or certificates  

### **3. Optional Hardening**
- Disable Wi‑Fi sync if not required  
- Review paired devices in Settings → General → VPN & Device Management  

---

## 📌 **Conclusion**
The iPhone at 192.168.1.127 shows **no exploitable vulnerabilities** and maintains a **strong security posture**.  
The minimal attack surface and hardened architecture significantly reduce the likelihood of remote compromise.

This report demonstrates proficiency in:

- Host discovery  
- Port scanning  
- Service enumeration  
- Risk assessment  
- Professional SOC‑style reporting
